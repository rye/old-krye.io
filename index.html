				<p>
					Hello!  My name is Kristofer Rye.  I am a
					programmer, hacker, musician, and high school
					student, currently living in Minnesota.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am an avid Emacs, GNU Nano, and Ed user, but I
					have used many other editors and IDE's such as
					NetBeans, Eclipse, Geany, Gedit, and Vi/Vim.

					In addition to these editors, I have copious
					experience with ZSH, Bash, and SH.  At one point,
					I had also written my own personal shell, but it
					had very limited abilities and was thus given up
					on.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I'm not hacking on projects or daydreaming
					about doing so, I'm generally playing my cello.
					I've been doing that for about 4 years and have
					gotten pretty good at that.

					I am working on adding more content to this
