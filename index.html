				<p>
					Hello!  My name is Kristofer Rye.  I am a
					programmer, hacker, musician, and high school
					student, currently living in Minnesota.
				</p>

				<p>
					I am an avid open-source fanatic, and almost all
					of my projects either are or will soon be
					open-sourced on my <a href="https://github.com/rye">GitHub profile</a>.
					I have a large amount of experience in Ruby,
					JavaScript, and C/C++, but I am able to quickly
					learn new frameworks as necessary.
				</p>

				<p>
					When I'm not hacking on projects or daydreaming
					about doing so, I'm generally playing my cello.
					I've been doing that for about 4 years and have
					gotten pretty good at that.  I am a former member
					of the <a href="http://www.wvys.org/">Wabash&nbsp;Valley&nbsp;Youth&nbsp;Symphony</a>,
					and am currently part of the <a href="http://www.brainerdmusic.org/chamber-orchestra.html">Brainerd&nbsp;Chamber&nbsp;Orchestra</a>.
					Outside of that, I am also playing in the <a href="https://www.heartlandsymphony.org/">Heartland&nbsp;Symphony&nbsp;Orchestra</a>.
